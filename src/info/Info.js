                    As part of a university project I developed a computer graphics
                    simulation using Unreal Engine as the foundation. The project's
                    primary objective was to create a graphical simulation of a
                    non-existing device, a Dose rate Meter Device with Teletector,
                    designed to detect photon radiation in various scenarios such as
                    X-rays radiation, Tube radio, gamma radiation, non-ionizing radiation,
                    alpha, and beta radiation. To achieve this, I utilized Blender to
                    create the necessary 3D models. The simulation aimed to provide
                    viewers with an immersive experience, allowing them to learn about the
                    appearance and functionality of such a device. Through this project,
                    users could gain valuable insights into the use and importance of Dose
                    rate meter tools in various radiation detection scenarios
